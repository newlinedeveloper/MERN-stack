### **Schema Design in MongoDB**

1. **How do you model one-to-many and many-to-many relationships in MongoDB? Provide examples.**  
   - **One-to-Many**:
     - **Embedding**: For tightly coupled data.
       ```json
       {
           "_id": 1,
           "author": "John Doe",
           "books": [
               {"title": "Book A", "year": 2021},
               {"title": "Book B", "year": 2022}
           ]
       }
       ```
     - **Referencing**: For loosely coupled data.
       ```json
       // Author Document
       { "_id": 1, "name": "John Doe" }

       // Book Document
       { "_id": 101, "authorId": 1, "title": "Book A" }
       ```

   - **Many-to-Many**:
     - Use a **join collection**:
       ```json
       // Authors
       { "_id": 1, "name": "John Doe" }
       { "_id": 2, "name": "Jane Smith" }

       // Books
       { "_id": 101, "title": "Book A" }
       { "_id": 102, "title": "Book B" }

       // Author-Book Relationship
       { "authorId": 1, "bookId": 101 }
       { "authorId": 2, "bookId": 101 }
       ```

2. **What factors influence whether you should embed or reference data in MongoDB?**  
   - **Embed Data**:
     - Use for small, tightly coupled, or frequently accessed together data.
     - Example: Blog posts with comments.
   - **Reference Data**:
     - Use for large, loosely coupled data or data shared across collections.
     - Example: Users referenced in multiple posts or products.

3. **How do you handle schema evolution in MongoDB when requirements change?**  
   - Add new fields with default values or nullable fields.
   - Use a migration script to transform old documents.
   - Maintain backward compatibility by supporting both old and new schema versions temporarily.

### **Indexing in MongoDB**

4. **How do indexes work in MongoDB, and what are their advantages?**  
   - Indexes are data structures that store a small portion of the dataset in an efficient form.
   - **Advantages**:
     - Improve query performance.
     - Enable sorting and filtering.
     - Support unique constraints.

5. **What types of indexes are available in MongoDB, and when should each be used?**  
   - **Single-Field Index**: For simple lookups.
   - **Compound Index**: For queries involving multiple fields.
   - **Text Index**: For full-text search.
   - **Geospatial Index**: For geospatial queries.
   - **TTL Index**: For expiring documents after a specified time.

6. **Explain how compound indexes work and provide an example.**  
   - Compound indexes define a sorted order for multiple fields.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     db.orders.createIndex({ customerId: 1, orderDate: -1 });
     ```
     - Optimized for queries like:
       ```javascript
       db.orders.find({ customerId: 123 }).sort({ orderDate: -1 });
       ```

7. **How do you identify and resolve slow queries in MongoDB?**  
   - **Analyze with `explain()`**:
     ```javascript
     db.collection.find({ field: value }).explain("executionStats");
     ```
   - Look for:
     - Collection scans (`COLLSCAN`).
     - High execution time.
   - Resolve by:
     - Adding indexes.
     - Optimizing queries (e.g., using `$in` instead of `$or`).

### **Aggregation in MongoDB**

8. **What is the aggregation framework in MongoDB, and how does it compare to SQL's `GROUP BY`?**  
   - The aggregation framework processes data through a pipeline of stages.
   - Similar to `GROUP BY` in SQL but more flexible, supporting transformations, projections, and complex analytics.

9. **Explain the purpose of the `$lookup` stage in aggregation pipelines. How does it handle large datasets?**  
   - **Purpose**: Performs a left outer join between collections.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     db.orders.aggregate([
         {
             $lookup: {
                 from: "customers",
                 localField: "customerId",
                 foreignField: "_id",
                 as: "customerDetails"
             }
         }
     ]);
     ```
   - **Handling Large Datasets**: Use indexed fields in `localField` and `foreignField` to improve performance.

10. **How would you optimize a complex aggregation pipeline in MongoDB?**  
    - Use `$match` and `$project` early to reduce data.
    - Use `$merge` or `$out` for intermediate results in large pipelines.
    - Index fields used in `$lookup` and `$group`.

11. **What are `$facet` and `$bucket` stages, and when should you use them?**  
    - **`$facet`**: Executes multiple aggregation pipelines in parallel.
      Example: Split results into statistics and filtered data.
    - **`$bucket`**: Groups documents into ranges.
      Example:
      ```javascript
      db.sales.aggregate([
          {
              $bucket: {
                  groupBy: "$amount",
                  boundaries: [0, 100, 200, 300],
                  default: "Other",
                  output: { count: { $sum: 1 } }
              }
          }
      ]);
      ```
