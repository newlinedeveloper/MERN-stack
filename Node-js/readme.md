## ✅ **2. Intermediate**

These questions dig into practical server-side development using Node.js:

* **What is the difference between `process.nextTick()`, `setImmediate()`, and `setTimeout()`?**
* **How do you handle exceptions in Node.js (sync vs async errors)?**
* **How do you create a simple HTTP server in Node.js?**
* **What are streams in Node.js? How are they used (e.g. for file processing)?**
* **What is middleware in Express.js?**
* **How is error handling implemented in Express.js middleware?**
* **How do you manage environment-specific configurations in a Node.js app?**
* **How does Node.js handle file I/O?**

## ✅ **3. Advanced Topics**

These are often asked in senior-level or system design interviews:

* **What is clustering in Node.js and when would you use it?**
* **How do you scale a Node.js application?**
* **How do you implement caching in a Node.js API (e.g., using Redis)?**
* **What is event-driven architecture? How does Node.js leverage it?**
* **What are worker threads and when should you use them over child processes?**
* **How do you handle memory leaks in Node.js?**
* **How do you secure a Node.js application against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, injection attacks)?**
* **How does Node.js handle backpressure in streams?**

---

## ✅ **4. Node.js + Database Questions**

* **How do you connect Node.js to MongoDB/PostgreSQL/MySQL?**
* **What is the difference between using a driver vs an ORM (e.g., Mongoose, Sequelize)?**
* **How do you structure a REST API using Express and MongoDB?**
* **How do you handle transactions in MongoDB with Node.js?**

---

## ✅ **5. Performance and Optimization**

* **What causes the “Event loop blocked” issue in Node.js and how do you avoid it?**
* **How do you profile and debug performance bottlenecks in a Node.js application?**
* **What tools do you use to monitor a Node.js app in production (e.g., PM2, New Relic, ELK stack)?**

---

## ✅ **6. Testing and CI/CD**

* **How do you test Node.js applications? Which libraries do you use (Jest, Mocha, Supertest)?**
* **What is the difference between unit, integration, and end-to-end testing in Node.js?**
* **How do you mock database or API calls in tests?**
* **How do you set up CI/CD for a Node.js application (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Docker)?**

---

## ✅ **7. Real-World Scenarios**

* **How would you design a rate limiter in Node.js?**
* **How would you handle millions of concurrent requests in a Node.js API?**
* **How would you log and trace errors across distributed microservices in Node.js?**
* **How do you handle authentication (JWT, OAuth) in Node.js apps?**

---

## Bonus: **Express.js Specific Questions**

* **How do you set up route-level middleware in Express?**
* **What is `next()` in Express middleware?**
