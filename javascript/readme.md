* Explain the concept of **hoisting**.
* What are **closures** and how are they used?
* What is the difference between `==` and `===`?
* What is a **promise**? How is it different from callbacks?
* What is the event loop and how does JavaScript handle asynchronous code?
* Explain the concept of **lexical scoping**.
* What is **currying** in JavaScript?

### **ES6+ Specific**

* What are **arrow functions** and how do they differ from regular functions?
* How do `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` work? Can you give examples?
* Explain **destructuring assignment**.
* What is the spread (`...`) and rest operator? How are they different?

## ðŸ”¹ **Object-Oriented and Functional JS**

* How does **prototypal inheritance** work in JavaScript?
* What is the difference between a class and a constructor function?
* What is the purpose of `Object.create()`?
* Explain **call**, **apply**, and **bind** methods.
* What are **pure functions**?
* What is **immutability** and how can it be enforced in JavaScript?

---

## ðŸ”¹ **Asynchronous JavaScript**

* Explain `async` / `await`. How is it better than Promises?
* What happens if you `await` a non-promise?
* How would you handle multiple asynchronous requests in parallel and wait for all of them?

  * (`Promise.all`, `Promise.race`)
* What are **microtasks** and **macrotasks**?

## ðŸ”¹ **DOM and Browser Environment**

* How does event delegation work?
* What is the difference between `e.preventDefault()` and `e.stopPropagation()`?

* How do debouncing and throttling work?

---

## ðŸ”¹ **Code / Algorithm Questions**

* Reverse a string in JavaScript.
* Flatten a nested array.
* Write a function to **deep clone** an object.
* Implement a **debounce** or **throttle** function.
* Group an array of objects by a property.
* Write a custom implementation of `Array.prototype.map`.

## ðŸ”¹ **Performance and Optimization**

* How do you optimize a large list rendering in the browser?
* How to detect and reduce memory leaks?
* What tools can be used to profile JS performance in the browser?

---

## ðŸ”¹ **Testing and Tooling**

* How would you write unit tests for a JavaScript function?
* What is the difference between `jest.fn()` and `jest.mock()`?
* What linters or formatters do you use? How do they help?

---

## ðŸ”¹ **Security**

* What is XSS and how do you prevent it in a JS app?
* What is CSRF and how can it be mitigated?

---

## ðŸ§  **Advanced Topics (For Senior/Mid-Level Roles)**

* How does JavaScript garbage collection work?
* How does the `this` keyword behave in different contexts (object method, arrow function, event handler)?
* What is **module bundling** and how do ES Modules differ from CommonJS?
* How would you implement a simple **pub-sub (observer)** pattern?
